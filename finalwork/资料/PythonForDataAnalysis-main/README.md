# PythonForDataAnalysis
Repository created for the final project of the Python for Data Analysis Class, made by Thomas Hubert, about the Estimation of obesity levels based on eating habits and physical condition Data Set.

The question I asked myself was : What are the main parameters beside Weight and Height that influence the « Obesity Level » of the person ?
 

## I. Exploring the Data

During this task, I used Pandas Dataframe to explore the dataset given and ensuring that the dataset was usable.

## II. Finding correlation 

By using heatmap and comparing percentage, I was able to answer which parameters, which behaviours were linked with the obesity level of a person.

## III. finding a model 

I tested some model such as Random Forest Regressor and KNeighborRegressor to find the most adapted one, then I tuned its parameters.

## IV. Flask API

I then created the Flask API using the selected model.


### Conclusion :

The eating habit are the most correlated with the obesity level, along with the family history, which is understandable as those habits can come from the family itself.
